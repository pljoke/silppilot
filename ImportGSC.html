In picture B, the ropes are at an angle. This angle splits their pulling force into two parts: a vertical component that lifts the pipe and a horizontal component that is wasted pulling the ropes against each other.

A door's weight constantly tries to pull it downward and away from the cabinet due to gravity. The hinges must work together to resist this force. By placing the hinges far apart, as on door B, you create a wide, stable base. This maximizes the leverage the hinges have against the door's weight, significantly reducing the stress on each hinge and preventing the door from sagging. The hinges on door A are too close together, creating a very weak support structure that puts immense stress on the hinges and the wood, which would quickly cause the door to sag, bind, and swing poorly", "setId": "GSC", "hasImage": true}, {"id": 20, "text": "When the left-hand gear turns in the direction shown, which way does the right-hand one turn?

When two externally meshed gears touch, they always rotate in opposite directions. You can trace the motion step-by-step: the first gear on the left turns counter-clockwise, which forces the second gear to turn clockwise. The second gear then forces the third gear to turn counter-clockwise. Finally, the third gear forces the fourth (right-hand) gear to turn clockwise.

For a very fast car, the higher and outer part of the track (B) is the best path. This is because it has a larger turning radius and a steeper banking angle. Both of these factors work together to provide the massive amount of centripetal force required to keep the fast-moving car on the track.

When the lobe engages a tooth on the lower wheel, it pushes it, causing a sudden rotation or \"jerk.\" After the lobe passes, the lower wheel stops until the next full rotation.
